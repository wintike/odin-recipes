    <h2><strong>Double Reese's Peanut Butter Ice Cream</strong></h2>
    <p> - <em>a delicious vanilla ice cream studded with two varieties of Reese's candy - peanut butter cups and Reese's pieces.  This ice cream will please every peanut butter cup fan.</em></p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups half-and-half</li>
        <li>2 cups heavy cream divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li> ¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 4-ounce box Reese's pieces candy</li>
        <li>3 1.5 ounce packages Reese's peanut butter cups chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan placed over medium heat, add the half-and-half and 1 ½ cups of the heavy cream. Add sugar and salt and whisk until dissolved. </li>
        <li>While the cream mixture heats, add 2 egg yolks to the remaining ½ cup of heavy cream, whisking to combine. When the cream is hot, slowly ladle some of the hot cream into the cream and egg yolks, whisking continuously. This tempers the eggs.</li>
        <li>Then slowly pour the egg yolk mixture into the hot cream mixture, while whisking. Cook over medium-low heat until slightly thickened, being careful not to boil the cream mixture.</li>
        <li>Strain the mixture into a heat-proof bowl.  Whisk in the vanilla extract.  Cover with plastic wrap, pressing the plastic wrap directly on top of the cream mixture. Refrigerate until completely chilled.
        </li>
        <li>Transfer to an ice cream machine and churn until the mixture is the consistency of soft serve. Transfer to a freezer-safe container. Fold in Reese's pieces candy and the chopped peanut butter cups. Freeze until firm, approx 3-4 hours.</li>
    </ol>
